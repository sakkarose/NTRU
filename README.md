# NTRU
Just a simple implementation of **NTRU** which is one of the **Round-3 Finalists of Post-Quantum Cryptography** in **Public-key Encryption and Key-establishment Algorithms**. This is just for studying purposes so the code can be unoptimized.

For simple implementation, `sympy` is used for polynomial. So for the larger polynomial rings, this might needs more works. `numpy` is also needed for this to run.
